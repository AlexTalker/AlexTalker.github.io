# What is Tesseract?

[Tesseract](http://tesseract.gg) provides a unique open-source engine derived from Cube 2: Sauerbraten technology but with upgraded modern rendering techniques. The new rendering features include fully dynamic omnidirectional shadows, global illumination, HDR lighting, deferred shading, morphological/temporal/multisample anti-aliasing, and much more.

# So...

I was surprised how easy will be create/edit map.Cube's idea is really good thing. You will make complicated things use only mouse. Also resulted file map have small  size than, for example Quake 3 maps.Its maybe good for people with low speed internet or who worry about free disk space.
But, unlikely in Quake, you can't make something new instead of current functionally(Quake support own language, named QuakeC, which will help you make complicated and new things for maps).Thats mean if you want added, for example, car support, you need make it in the engine and each user should use this engine if he want use car.

# End

My first work you will see by link in head of page. See you, anonymous.
